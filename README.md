# Portfolio-website

**Description**

This is a repository for my Portfolio Website project. The portfolio website showcases my skills, projects, and experiences to potential employers and collaborators. It serves as an online resume and a way for others to get to know more about me and my work.

The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it is designed to be responsive and accessible on different devices and browsers. It includes sections such as:

Home: An introduction to myself and a brief overview of what I do.
About: More detailed information about my background, skills, and experiences.
Projects: A collection of projects I've worked on, with descriptions and links to their respective repositories or live demos.
Contact: A way for visitors to get in touch with me through a contact form or links to my social media profiles.
